# The program will be using if statements to basically simulate an authentication function, the username and password are admin and adminpass 
# Program should run by doing .\main.exe as for the OS without the login .\os.exe should run it. 
# I had free time from my classes and finals so I decided to add a form of GUI to make the simulation seem more realistic. I did do a lot of google searching for that part though as I wasn't too sure how to complete it.
