# The program will be using if statements to basically simulate an authentication function, the username and password are admin and adminpass 
# I'm using the web version of github at the moment but the terminal wont let the code run unless this command is ran g++ main.cpp auth.cpp -o main ./main  
# not sure if that issue will presist on non web version but it lets the program run, just in case it doesn't.
