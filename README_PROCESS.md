The way this process works is rather simple. First I used the variables/attributes stated in the instructions and created a class. 
Two different files were created for this process. 
Within them a consturctor that initializes the attributes was created then the executions to guide those attributes. 
Such as start() which makes the process "initiate", wait() which pauses the process, finish() which will calculate the waiting and turnaround times and finally display() whcih will simply just print the information that the user sees in the "operating system"
